# Rich Bot

Richbot is a Discord bot imitating voice actor Richard Epcar. The bot includes image posting, the ability to enter voice chats, and the ability to play YouTube audio, either from a list of catchphrases or from custom links.

## Installation

Feel free to fork the repo and host a version on Heroku or a similar hosting platform.


## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change.

The bot is currently in disrepair. This is due to changes in the YouTube library, as well as discord's developer tools overhaul.
